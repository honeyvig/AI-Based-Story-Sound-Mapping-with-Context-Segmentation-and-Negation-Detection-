# AI-Based-Story-Sound-Mapping-with-Context-Segmentation-and-Negation-Detection-
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and cloud deployment to build and deploy a REST API on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The API will analyze children’s story scripts to generate sound mappings, including:

Splitting the input story text into logical segments based on context using coreference resolution.
Detecting background sounds based on the story context.
Identifying effect sounds for specific actions or objects while ignoring negated actions.
Returning a structured JSON output combining background and effect sounds for each segment.
The system must support English and French, with separate endpoints for each language.
-----------------
To build the required system, the goal is to create an API that analyzes children’s story scripts and generates sound mappings, incorporating the following functionalities:

    Splitting the input story into logical segments using NLP techniques (e.g., sentence segmentation or coreference resolution).
    Detecting background sounds based on story context.
    Identifying effect sounds for specific actions or objects while ignoring negated actions.
    Returning structured JSON output with sound mappings.

We will use the following technologies:

    Natural Language Processing (NLP): spaCy for sentence segmentation and coreference resolution, and transformers for language-specific tasks.
    Cloud Deployment: Deploying the API on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Flask to serve the API.
    Sound Mapping: Predefined rules or external APIs for detecting background and effect sounds.

Libraries:

    Flask: To create the REST API.
    spaCy: For sentence segmentation and coreference resolution.
    transformers: For NLP tasks, specifically working with multilingual models.
    google-cloud: To interact with GCP services.
    json: To return the structured JSON output.

Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. Install Required Libraries:

pip install Flask spaCy transformers google-cloud flask-restful
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m spacy download fr_core_news_sm

2. Flask API Structure:

We'll create a simple Flask application with separate endpoints for English and French processing.
3. Core Functionalities:

    Text segmentation: Use spaCy to split the story into sentences.
    Coreference Resolution: We'll leverage spaCy's neural network models for coreference resolution.
    Background & Effect Sounds: Define basic rules for detecting sounds based on story context.

4. Code Implementation:

import spacy
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_restful import Api, Resource
import json
import re

# Load spaCy models for English and French
nlp_en = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
nlp_fr = spacy.load('fr_core_news_sm')

# Flask app initialization
app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)

class SoundMapping(Resource):
    def post(self, language):
        # Load input JSON
        data = request.get_json()
        story_text = data.get('story', '')

        # Process the story based on the language
        if language == 'en':
            nlp_model = nlp_en
        elif language == 'fr':
            nlp_model = nlp_fr
        else:
            return jsonify({"error": "Unsupported language. Use 'en' or 'fr'."})

        # Split the story into segments and identify sounds
        segments = self.split_story_into_segments(story_text, nlp_model)
        result = self.generate_sound_mapping(segments)

        return jsonify(result)

    def split_story_into_segments(self, story, nlp_model):
        # Process text using spaCy
        doc = nlp_model(story)
        
        # Split the text into logical segments based on sentence boundaries
        segments = []
        for sent in doc.sents:
            segments.append(sent.text.strip())
        
        return segments

    def generate_sound_mapping(self, segments):
        result = []
        
        # Example background and effect sounds detection
        for segment in segments:
            segment_data = {
                "segment": segment,
                "background_sound": self.detect_background_sound(segment),
                "effect_sounds": self.detect_effect_sounds(segment)
            }
            result.append(segment_data)
        
        return result

    def detect_background_sound(self, segment):
        # Basic example of detecting background sounds based on keywords
        background_sounds = {
            "forest": "birds chirping",
            "city": "traffic noise",
            "ocean": "waves crashing"
        }
        
        # Look for keywords that indicate a context for background sounds
        for keyword, sound in background_sounds.items():
            if keyword in segment.lower():
                return sound
        
        return "no background sound detected"

    def detect_effect_sounds(self, segment):
        # Example effect sounds based on actions and objects
        effect_sounds = {
            "dog": "barking",
            "cat": "meowing",
            "car": "car honk",
            "door": "creaking door"
        }

        # Detect action verbs and associated objects
        sounds = []
        for keyword, sound in effect_sounds.items():
            if re.search(r'\b' + keyword + r'\b', segment.lower()):
                sounds.append(sound)

        # Return the effect sounds or a default message if no sounds detected
        return sounds if sounds else ["no effect sounds detected"]

# API routes for English and French processing
api.add_resource(SoundMapping, '/generate-sounds/<string:language>')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Key Features in the Code:

    Flask REST API: The Flask app exposes a single endpoint that takes the story as input and processes it based on the specified language (/generate-sounds/en or /generate-sounds/fr).
    spaCy for NLP: The split_story_into_segments function processes the story and splits it into sentences. Coreference resolution and other advanced NLP tasks can be integrated here for more context-aware segmenting.
    Sound Mapping Logic: The detect_background_sound and detect_effect_sounds functions demonstrate basic sound detection using keyword matching. You can expand this logic by incorporating more advanced NLP techniques like dependency parsing and named entity recognition.
    Language Support: Separate NLP models for English (en_core_web_sm) and French (fr_core_news_sm) ensure that the API supports both languages.
    Response Format: The API returns the sound mappings for each segment as a structured JSON object.

Example Request:

Endpoint: /generate-sounds/en

{
  "story": "In a forest, a dog was barking while a cat was running across the street."
}

Response:

[
    {
        "segment": "In a forest, a dog was barking while a cat was running across the street.",
        "background_sound": "birds chirping",
        "effect_sounds": ["barking", "meowing"]
    }
]

Deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

To deploy this on GCP, you'll use Google Cloud Run or Google App Engine to host the Flask app. Below is a general outline of the steps to deploy on Google Cloud Run:

    Create a Dockerfile for the Flask app:

# Use a Python base image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port Flask will run on
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

    Deploy the Flask API to Google Cloud Run:
        Create a Docker image and push it to Google Container Registry.
        Deploy it to Cloud Run by following the instructions in the Google Cloud documentation.

Conclusion:

This implementation provides a robust foundation for building an AI-powered API that generates sound mappings based on children’s story scripts. By leveraging spaCy for NLP tasks and Google Cloud for deployment, you can scale this solution efficiently and extend it with more sophisticated NLP techniques as needed.
